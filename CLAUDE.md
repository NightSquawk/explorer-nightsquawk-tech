# CLAUDE.md

## Git Workflow

- **Never commit directly to `main`.** Always create a feature branch for changes.
- **Run `pnpm lint` before every commit.** Fix any lint errors before committing.

## Changesets

Every PR must include a changeset. Run `pnpm changeset` to create one.

- If the PR includes user-facing changes, write a changelog entry describing what changed with examples.
- If the PR is internal-only (refactoring, CI, docs, tooling), add an empty changeset with `pnpm changeset --empty`.

## Testing

- **Any UI changes must be covered by E2E tests.** Playwright E2E tests live in `packages/dashboard/e2e/`. Run them with `pnpm test:e2e`.
- Run component tests with `pnpm --filter r2-explorer-dashboard test`.
- Run all tests (worker + dashboard) with `pnpm test`.


## In-the-Moment Activity Logging (Billing)

explorer-nightsquawk-tech is an NST-internal repo: work here defaults to **NST-internal** (`kimai_candidate: no`) but must still be logged - the NST master activity log is also the future-search index. If a task is a deliverable for a paying client or tenant, tag that client instead and set `kimai_candidate: yes`. **`{host}` is not optional and is not a label to leave literal** - determine it yourself before naming the file: run `hostname` (Linux/macOS) or `$env:COMPUTERNAME` (Windows PowerShell) / `echo %COMPUTERNAME%` (cmd), lowercase the result, keep only the part before the first dot, and replace anything that isn't `[a-z0-9_-]` with a dash. This applies even though this repo lives outside the NST vault - the inbox is shared across all NightSquawk repos and machines, and a stub filename with no host segment is itself a defect. Canonical SOP: `C:\Users\reyes\NightSquawk Tech\in-the-moment-logging-sop.md` (NST Rule 11).

Substantive = a feature, fix, refactor, build or packaging pass, release, deployment, or significant debugging session. Skip pure Q&A and code reading.

- **At task start:** spawn a **background** logging subagent (never block the real work) that writes a stub entry - one file per task - to `$NST_ACTIVITY_INBOX/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-{host}-{slug}.md` (Linux `/mnt/data/work/.activity-log-inbox/`; Windows `<data-drive>:\work\.activity-log-inbox\`) with frontmatter `client: NST-internal`, `status: stub`, `kimai_candidate: no`.
- **At task end:** complete the entry (`status: complete`): what was done, commit hashes + subjects, branch, VERSION or changelog bump if any, build artifacts, deploys, and any endpoints or systems touched.
- **Single write** to the NST inbox only. Never create activity-log files inside this repo, and never append `activity-log-YYYY-MM.md` directly - the single-writer consolidation pass owns the monthly logs.
- Automatic breadcrumbs are only a safety net: Claude writes `breadcrumbs-YYYY-MM.log` via the global `SessionEnd` hook; Codex writes `codex-breadcrumbs-YYYY-MM.log` via the global `Stop` hook. The subagent entry is what makes the work readable for billing. Short tasks may skip the stub and write one complete entry at the end.
